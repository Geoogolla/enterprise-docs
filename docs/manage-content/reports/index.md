## Add a chart report item

The left pane in the design view consists of basic items, data region, data visualization, and sub reports  to design an interactive report.

> Here, the `Chart` report item is used for demonstration.

1. Select any of the `Chart` type in the left pane, then drag and drop it to the design area.
   > Here, `Column` chart is used for demonstration.

2. The above action will render the `Chart` report item in the design area.

### Assign Data

> This step is applicable only for the report items that belongs to `data visualization` and `data region` category.

1. To bind data to a report item placed in the design area, focus on that report item.
   ![Focus chart item](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-reports/create-reports/focus-report-item.png)
2. Click `Properties` button in the configuration panel, the property pane opens. Now, switch to `DATA` tab.
   ![Chart properties pane](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-reports/create-reports/chart-properties-pane.png)
3. The `DATA` tab holds data configuration view.
4. The available data in the report will be listed in the drop-down, choose a data in the drop-down list.
![Choose the dataset for chart](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-reports/create-reports/data-assign-drop-down.png)
5. The numeric columns and numeric expressions are listed under the `Measures` section; other type of columns and dimension expressions are listed under the `Dimensions` section.
   ![Measures and dimensions](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-reports/create-reports/measures-dimensions-category.png)

   ![Add a Y-value field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-reports/create-reports/add-y-values-field.png)
   Now, the report item design will look like below:
   ![Preview after adding y-value field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-reports/create-reports/y-value-chart-design-view.png)
7. **Aggregate Options**:
   Click the `Settings` icon (highlighted below) to open the aggregation type drop-down list.
   ![Aggregate settings icon](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-reports/create-reports/aggregation-settings-icon.png)
   You can set the aggregation type by which you can compute the selected column.
   ![Aggregate menu list](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-reports/create-reports/aggregation-settings-menu.png)
8. **Drag and Drop Dimension Element**:
   Select and drag the dimension element from the `Dimensions` section to measure against any of the selected numeric column(s) in `Y Value(s)` section, and drop into the `Column(s)` section.  
   ![Add dimension field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-reports/create-reports/add-field-to-column-section.png)
   Now, the report item design will look like below:
   ![Preview after adding dimension field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-reports/create-reports/column-field-design-preview.png)
9. **Grouping**:
   You can group the added column element with another column, by adding the respective dimension element into Row(s) section.
   ![Achieve grouping by row values](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-reports/create-reports/add-field-to-rows-section.png)
   Now, the report item design will look like below.

### Customize the appearance

Navigate to the `PROPERTIES` tab in the properties pane.
