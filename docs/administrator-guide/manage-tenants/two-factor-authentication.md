# Two Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication(2FA) has been implemented to enhance the security of your Bold Reports account, adding an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access. With 2FA enabled, you will be prompted to enter a verification code generated by your smartphone during each login.

To enable or disable Two-Factor Authentication for the user account, please refer to this [link](../../user-profile/#two-factor-authentication)

If you have 2FA enabled, the Bold Reports login page will request a verification code. You can enter the verification code generated by any TOTP (Time-based One-time Password) application or use a recovery code to confirm your identity. You also have the option to skip 2FA verification on your future logins by enabling the `Don't ask again on this device` check box.
