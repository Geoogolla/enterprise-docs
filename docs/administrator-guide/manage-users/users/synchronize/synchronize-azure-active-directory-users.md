# Azure Active Directory User Synchronization

This section explains how to synchronize the imported Azure Active Directory users details with the Azure Active Directory.

> Before synchronizing the Azure Active Directory users, follow the given steps:
1. Configure [Azure Active Directory Settings](/administrator-guide/manage-app-settings/azure-active-directory/).
2. Import users from the Azure Active Directory to the Bold Reports by referring the following link [Active Directory User Import](/administrator-guide/manage-users/users/import-users/import-azure-active-directory-users/).

You can navigate to the user synchronization page from users page as shown in the below figure.

### Synchronization procedure

* Bold Reports will synchronize the user details - username, first name, last name, email address, contact number with the Azure Active Directory Server.

* Bold Reports will delete the user if the user has deleted from the Azure Active Directory Server.

After synchronization completes, the number of users modified, deleted, duplicated will be shown in the success message box as shown in the below figure.
