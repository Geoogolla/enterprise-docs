# Import users from CSV

To automate the process of adding a large number of users to Bold Report On-Premise, download the CSV template file, add the users to it, and then import the file.

You can navigate to the user management page by clicking the `User` menu, as shown below.

## CSV template requirements

The first row in the CSV template represents the column heading. Bold Reports assumes that the data starting from the second line in the file represents the user information.

We consider the following columns as mandatory in the downloaded CSV file.

* Username
* Email address (It is mandatory only in the [Email required](./../../../../manage-users/account-activation/#email-required) mode).
* Full Name
* Password (It is mandatory only in the [Automatic activation](./../../../../manage-users/account-activation/#automatic-activation) mode).

Follow the below steps to add users using the CSV template

1. Download a CSV template.
