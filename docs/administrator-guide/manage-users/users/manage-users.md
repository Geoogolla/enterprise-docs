# Manage Users

## Add new users

New users can be added to the Bold Reports Server individually or in bulk using CSV import

### Add individual users

To add new users to the Bold Reports Server, click on `New User` and then `Create User` from the User Management page.

The `Add User` dialog will be shown as like in the image below.

> **NOTE** : An email address is mandatory only in `Email required` mode.

New account will be created for the user and an account activation email will be sent to the email address with activation link to activate the Bold Reports Server account.

The activation link sent to the user will be valid only for 2 days and if the user have not activated within the 2 days, a new activation link can be sent to the user from the user edit page. Check [Activate Users](#activate-users) section for more details.

The account will be in inactive status till the user activates the account from the activation email.

## Add individual users with password

To add users with the password, you have to set the Account Activation Mode to `Automatic` in the `Accounts` settings page.

## Import users from CSV

You can navigate to the user management page by clicking the `User Management` dropdown under the `Admin`menu as follows.

## Add users from CSV file

In Bold Reports, click `Import from csv`.

We have the following columns are considered as mandatory in the downloaded CSV file.

* Username

* Full Name
* Password (It is mandatory only in Automatic ``activation`` mode.)

## Deactivate users

Users can be deactivated at any time. Once deactivated, the user cannot log into the Bold Reports On-Premise.
To deactivate a user, select inactive from the status dropdown in the user edit page.

If the user has not received the activation email within 2 days or missed to activate the account, the `System Administrator` has to resend the activation email to the user.
