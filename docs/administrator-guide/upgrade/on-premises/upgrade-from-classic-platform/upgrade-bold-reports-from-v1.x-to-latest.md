# Upgrade Bold Reports On-Premise version from 1.x to latest

This section explains how to upgrade Bold Reports Server from any version to 2.x version.

Bold Reports releases several major versions in a year. Each version includes new features, bug fixes and other improvements.

Bold Report Server can be upgraded to version 2.x at any time manually, and there are no automatic updates for Report Server. Before upgrading, you can refer the features and enhancements from the [Release Notes](https://www.boldreports.com/release-history/2-2#2-2-28).

## Steps to upgrade Bold Reports On-Premise
