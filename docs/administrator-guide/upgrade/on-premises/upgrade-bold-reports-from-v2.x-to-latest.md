# Upgrade Bold Reports Enterprise Reporting version from 2.x to latest

This section explains how to upgrade Bold Reports Server from 2.x to latest.

Bold Reports releases several major versions in a year. Each version includes new features, bug fixes and other improvements.

Bold Report Server can be upgraded to latest version at any time manually, and there are automatic updates for Report Server. Before upgrading, you can refer the features and enhancements from the [Release Notes](https://www.boldreports.com/release-history/2-2#2-2-28).

## Upgrading guidelines

Bold Reports recommends you to follow below guidelines while upgrading the Bold Reports Server from an older version to latest version.

* Save all the open settings and the unsaved items.
* Ensure no one is currently working with reports.
* Inform about the maintenance time to the users.
* For databases, make sure you have a valid network connection to the database while upgrading to the new version.

## Backup the existing data

Before upgrading the Bold Reports to latest version, make sure to take the backup of all the files and folders from below location.
<table>
    <tr>
      <td>
       Bold IDP
      </td>
      <td>
      {Deployed Location}\IDP\App_Data
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
       Bold Reports
      </td>
      <td>
       {Deployed Location}\Report Server\App_Data
      </td>
    </tr>
    </table>

By default, Bold Reports will be deployed in "C:\Bold Reports\"
