# Built-in User Roles available with UMS and Site

Users granted admin permissions within both the User Management System (UMS) and specific reporting sites possess substantial control and responsibilities. These admin users hold the authority to oversee various facets of user accounts, access privileges, and site configurations. Below is a comprehensive overview of the capabilities that users with admin permissions can exercise on both UMS and reporting sites:

## Admin Permissions in UMS

* **Add, Edit, and Delete User Accounts**: Administrators have the ability to generate new user accounts, alter existing user details, and deactivate or remove user accounts when required.

* **Assign Permissions**: Admins can designate additional administrators for other users, distributing the responsibilities of managing user accounts.

* **Create and Manage Reporting Sites (Tenants)**: Administrators can establish and oversee multiple reporting sites, which function as segregated environments for distinct departments, clients, or projects.

* **Define Site Settings**: They possess the capability to configure site-specific settings, including branding, appearance, and access controls. This customization ensures the uniqueness of each reporting site.

## Admin Permissions within Reporting Sites (Tenants)

* **User Account Management**: Site administrators can seamlessly add, modify, and remove user accounts within the reporting site they are assigned to.

* **Group Management**: Admins have the authority to create, edit, and delete user groups within their reporting site. This simplifies the management of permissions.

* **Assign and Modify Group Permissions**: They can allocate precise permissions to user groups, thereby regulating access to reports and resources within their site.

* **Control User Access**: Administrators hold the power to grant or withdraw user access to the reporting site along with its contents.

* **Configure Site Settings**: Site admins can conveniently fine-tune site-specific settings, including design, layout, and data sources, to align with the requirements of their reporting environment.

* **Content Management**: Site administrators are responsible for overseeing the management of reports, data sources, and datasets within their reporting site, ensuring an organized and accessible collection of content.

This resource will guide you through the steps necessary to grant admin permissions to users within the User Management System and various reporting sites.

## Who can enable the admin role

In Bold Reports, only users with existing administrative privileges can enable the admin role for others. Regular users without administrative access lack the authority to assign the admin role to anyone. This restriction ensures that administrative privileges are granted solely to authorized individuals responsible for managing users and system settings within the Bold Reports platform. Enabling the admin role is typically reserved for superusers, system administrators, or individuals with equivalent high-level access and responsibilities.
