The previous mentioned similar steps are applicable to configure the OpenID Connect in User Management Server by logging into the URL `{Bold Reports URL}/ums/administration/authentication` with admin credential.

Following are the list of few OpenID Connect providers and that explains how to connect with the Bold Reports application.

* [Auth0](./../openid-connect/auth0/)
