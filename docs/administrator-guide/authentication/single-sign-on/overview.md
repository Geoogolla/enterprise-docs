# What is Single sign-on

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that allows users to securely authenticate with multiple applications and websites using just one set of credentials. This eliminates the need for users to log in separately to different applications. With a single security token (a username and password pair), you can manage user access to multiple systems, apps, and resources. It has revolutionized the traditional login process, reducing the time-consuming need to log in to each application with different passwords.
