# Mark Reports as Public - Allow/Restrict Switch

This section provides instructions on enabling or restricting the ability to mark reports as public from the Reports Settings page. Administrators can control whether users have the ability to designate reports as public by enabling the **Mark reports as public** option.

## Take Control Over the Public Reports

If the Administrator has allowed, users can mark reports as public, and other users can view these public reports. If the Administrator has restricted, users cannot mark reports as public, and they won't be visible to other users.

## Control Public Report Access

* The **Mark report as public** option is disabled by default on the Reports settings page.
