# User Based Filter

This section explains for the reports designed with user based filter expression and the data will be restricted based on the current logged-in user. We can configure which value(username/email) should be applied for the expression by selecting user based filter from `User Based Filter` tab in report settings. Based on the value chosen schedule mail will be sent to users and reports will render.

> For external users schedule mail will be failed, for report designed with user based filter expression.
