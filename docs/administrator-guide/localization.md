# Localization

Localization is the process of adapting a website into different linguistic and cultural contexts - involving much more than the simple translation of the text.

The default language is English “en-US” for Bold Reports On-Premise. Read the following documentation for more details.

## Adding new localizations

Clone your own culture for the [Bold Report Server](https://github.com/boldreports/server-localization) and add it to the application anytime.

## Adding localizations to the Bold Report On-premise

Copy your own culture **messages.po** file from the location where you have cloned from GitHub

Create a folder in the locale folder  with {language code}-{country code} and paste the cloned messages.po file inside the newly created folder.

| Installation Type | Folder Path |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Windows | Navigate to below installer folder: <br> {Installed_location}\BoldServices\reporting\web\locale</br> |
| Docker | Bash into the reports-web container. <br> Inside the container, go to the below location:</br> "/application/reporting/web/locale" | 

### Windows

For example, if you are translating to Germany, create a folder named de-DE and paste the messages.po like the below.
