## Application structure when common login selected

Bold Reports will be installed as a sub-application within the existing Bold BI Site, which is hosted on IIS. The following changes were made to IIS after using the common Bold ID. Normally, Bold BI is hosted with the site name `BoldBIEnterpriseEdition` in IIS, but after using the common login (Bold ID), the site name has been changed to `BoldAppsEnterpriseEdition`. Additionally, Bold Reports will be hosted as a sub-app called `reporting` under the `BoldAppsEnterpriseEdition` site.
