    ```

9. You can install the Bold Reports Enterprise Edition installer in two ways.

     a. [Configuring the application startup details during the installation](#configuring-the-application-startup-details-during-the-installation)

     b. [Silent installation alone without providing the application startup details](#silent-installation-alone-without-providing-the-application-startup-details)

### Configuring the application startup details during the installation

If you need to set the application configuration details during the setup installation itself, you can use this parameter list.

Once the silent installation was completed, your application will be configured by default and you can proceed to use the reports of BoldServices.

Download the [application_startup](https://github.com/boldreports/api-payload/blob/master/v2/application_startup.json) JSON file and provide ServerConfiguration, DataStoreConfiguration and UmsConfiguration details in application_startup.JSon file.

We have to provide Database, Storage and Site details in **ServerConfiguration**

![ServerConfiguration-reference](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/server-configuration-reference.png)

**Example,**

![ServerConfiguration-example](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/server-configuration-example.png)

We have to provide Database details in **DataStoreConfiguration**, it required to create BoldBIOnPremise tenants only.

![DataStoreConfiguration-reference](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/datastoreconfiguration-reference.png)

**Example,**

![DataStoreConfiguration-example](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/datastoreconfiguration-example.png)

We have to provide Database, Storage, User and unlockkey details in **UmsConfiguration**

![UmsConfiguration-reference](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/ums-configuration-reference.png)

**Example,**

![UmsConfiguration-example](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/ums-configuration-example.png)

After providing your inputs in the file, then set **IsSilentStartUp** to **true** and provide the path of JSON file to the installer as an argument.

![Silent-startUp-true](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/silent-startup-true.png)

**Example,**

![Command-line-startUp-true](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/command-line-startup-true.png)

![Bold-Reports-application](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/bold-reports-application.png)

### Silent installation alone without providing the application startup details

If you don’t want to provide the application startup configuration details during the silent installation, then set **IsSilentStartUp** to **false** and proceed with the installation.

![Silent-startUp-false](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/silent-startup-false.png)

**Example,**

![Command-line-startUp-false](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/command-line-startup-false.png)

![BoldReports-start-up](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/silent-installation/bold-ums-startup.png)

Once the setup installation is completed, you can provide the startup details in the Bold Reports application itself and configure it. Refer to the following [link](https://help.boldreports.com/enterprise-reporting/administrator-guide/application-startup/) for more information on application startup.
