# Prerequisites for Deploying Bold Reports Server on Microsoft Azure

To deploy Bold Reports server on Microsoft Azure, the following prerequisites are necessary:

1. A Microsoft Azure subscription is necessary. If you don't have one yet, you can take advantage of the free trial offered on the [Microsoft Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

2. You will require the Bold Reports Enterprise Edition. Please make sure you possess the appropriate license and download the build by following the instructions provided in this [help link](../../../getting-started/#registration-and-download).

3. Microsoft Remote Desktop must be installed on your computer. This is necessary to sign in to the Virtual Machine (VM) where the Bold Reports Server is installed. Note that Remote Desktop comes pre-installed on Windows-based operating systems.

> **Note:**  If you are using a Mac, the Remote Desktop client can be installed from the provided [link](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9WZDNCRFJ3PS?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab&hl=en-us&gl=US). For Linux users, [rdesktop](http://www.rdesktop.org/) can be used to connect to your Azure VM running Microsoft Windows. Additional information on connecting and logging in to an Azure virtual machine running Windows can be found on the [Microsoft Azure website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-rdp).
