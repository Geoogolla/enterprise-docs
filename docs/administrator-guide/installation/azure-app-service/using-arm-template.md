8. Fill the details as instructed in the following to complete the deployment steps.
    * **Subscription**: Choose the subscription that you have with Azure. Learn more about subscriptions from [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/arunrakwal/2012/04/09/create-windows-azure-subscription/).

    * **Resource group**: This is a logical group in Azure to group your resources like web app, storage account, network etc. Learn more about resource groups from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups).

    * **Location**: Choose the location to deploy the app. **East US** is our recommended location.

    * **Web App name**: This is the name of the Report Server that you want to have in the URL. As this is going to be the URL, it should be unique globally. Deployment process will be failed, if this is already present and you should start once again with another name.

    * **Storage account name**: This is mandatory for Blob storage and also must be unique as that of the Web App name. Learn more about storage accounts from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-introduction).

    * **Storage account type**: This is optional, if you have chosen file storage in storage type and mandatory for Blob storage. Learn more about storage account types from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-introduction#replication-for-durability-and-high-availability).

   > **Note:** Web App name and Storage account name should be in lowercase only.

9. Select the agreement check box and click **Purchase** to deploy the Bold Reports On-Premise Web App.

   Now, Bold Reports Multi-tenant App Service(Web App) deployment get started.

   > **Note:** Deployment process will take around 15 minutes to complete.

   The App Service plan for the Web App is created, which will be in `Basic – B1` by default. Learn more about App Service plans from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview). Bold Reports On-Premise Web App does not support free or shared App Service plans.

   Bold Reports On-Premise supports basic, standard, and premium App Service plans in the Azure. The minimum recommended App Service plan to run the application is the basic plan.

   To get better performance, scale up the App Service plan from basic to standard or premium plans. Refer to the following documentation links to learn how to scale up and scale out the App Service plan.
