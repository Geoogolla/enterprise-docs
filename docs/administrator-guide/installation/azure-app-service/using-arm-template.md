# Create a Bold Reports Azure App Service using the ARM template

To deploy the Bold Reports Azure web app using the ARM template, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Click **Create a resource** from the top menu.

4. Click **Create**.

5. Now, choose **Build your own template in the editor** within the Custom Deployment window.

6. [Click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boldreports/bold-reports-azure/master/armtemplates/v5.4.20/BoldReportsAppServiceTemplate.json)  to download the ARM template file.

7. Copy all the contents in the template file and replace them in the Edit template window, and then click **Save**.

8. Fill in the details as instructed in the following to complete the deployment steps.
    * **Subscription**: select the Azure subscription that you have. For more information about subscriptions, visit this [link](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/arunrakwal/2012/04/09/create-windows-azure-subscription/).

    * **Resource group**: This is a logical group in Azure to group your resources like web apps, storage accounts, networks, etc. Learn more about resource groups from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups).

    * **Location**: Choose the location to deploy the app. The **East US** is our recommended location.

    * **Web App name**: This is the name of the Report Server that you want to use in the URL. Since it will be the URL, it must be globally unique. If the chosen name is already in use, the deployment process will fail, and you will need to restart with another unique name.

    * **Storage account name**: This is mandatory for Blob storage and must be unique, similar to the Web App name. You can learn more about storage accounts [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).

    * **Storage account type**: This is optional for File storage in storage type but mandatory for Blob storage. Learn more about storage account types [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/object-replication-overview).

      > **Note:** The Web App name and Storage account name should be in lowercase only.

9. Click `Create` to initiate the deployment of the Bold Reports On-Premise Web App.
   ![Fill app service details](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation-and-deployment/azure-deployment/app-service-using-arm-template/custom-template-details-form.png)

   ![Fill app service details](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation-and-deployment/azure-deployment/app-service-using-arm-template/custom-template-details-form2.png)

   Now, the deployment of the Bold Reports Multi-tenant App Service (Web App) is getting started.

   > **Note:** The deployment process is expected to take around 15 minutes to complete.

   The App Service plan for the Bold Reports On-Premise Web App is automatically created, defaulting to `Basic â€“ B1`. Learn more about App Service plans [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview). Please note that Bold Reports On-Premise does not support free or shared App Service plans.

   Bold Reports On-Premise is compatible with basic, standard, and premium App Service plans in Azure. The recommended minimum App Service plan for optimal application performance is the basic plan.

   For improved performance, consider scaling up the App Service plan from basic to standard or premium. Refer to the following documentation links to learn how to scale up and scale out the App Service plan.
