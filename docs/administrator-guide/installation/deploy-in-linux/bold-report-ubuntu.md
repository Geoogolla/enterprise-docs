# Bold Reports Installation and Deployment on Ubuntu

## Deployment prerequisites

1. Access to a Linux server with a standard user account with sudo privileges.
2. Install `Nginx`.

    ```console
    sudo apt-get update
    ```  
    ```console
    sudo apt-get install nginx
    ```

3. Install zip.
    ```console
    sudo apt-get install zip
    ```
4. Install ``GDIPlus`` package using the following command.
    ```console
    sudo apt-get install libgdiplus
    ```
5. Add an ``openssl conf`` path in the environment, if does not exist.
    ```console
    export OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/ssl/
    ```

## Configuring the Bold Reports application

1. Register and download the Bold Reports Linux package from here.
2. Download the Bold Reports Linux package by running the following command.
    ```console
    sudo wget {Bold Reports Linux package link}
    ```
3. Extract the zip file.
    ```console
    sudo unzip {Bold Reports Linux package zip file}
    ```
4. Change the directory to `BoldReports_EnterpriseReporting-Linux` by running the following command.
    ```console
    cd BoldReports_EnterpriseReporting-Linux
    ```
5. Execute the following command to deploy Bold Reports in your Linux machine.
    ```console
     sudo bash install-boldreports.sh -i {new} -u {user} -h {host URL} -n {true or false}
     ```

     * **i** : Installation type - Specifies either it is a new or upgrade installation.

     * **u** : Specify the user or group that manages the service.

     * **h** : Domain or IP address of the machine with http protocol.

     * **n** : Setting this to “true” will automatically configure the Bold Reports with Nginx front-end server.

**IMPORTANT**: If you have any existing applications running in that Linux machine using Nginx, set “-n” value to false and configure the [Nginx manually](#manually-configure-nginx). Example for new installation,

```console
sudo bash install-boldreports.sh -i new -u www-data -h http://linux.example.com -n true
```

Once the installation completed, open the host URL in the browser and continue the application startup.

## Upgrade breaking changes

>**Note**:
> * After upgrading Bold Reports application to v3.2.22 from v3.1.x, you need to update below section of code in Nginx configuration file in the location
>`/etc/nginx/sites-available`.
> * This breaking changes should be done for both automatic and manual Nginx configurations.

**Old Nginx configuration file code**:

![Breaking Issue](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/breaking.png)

Replace below code in Nginx configuration file instead of above marked code,

```cmd
    location /reporting/reportservice {
        root               /var/www/bold-services/application/reporting/reportservice;
        proxy_pass         http://localhost:6553;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
```

Once the Nginx configuration is updated, run the `sudo nginx -t`  to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force the Nginx to pick up the changes by running the `sudo nginx -s reload`.

## Manually Configure Nginx

To configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward requests to the Bold Reports app, modify /etc/nginx/sites-available/default. Open it in a text editor, and add the following code.

```cmd
       #server {
       #listen 80;
       #server_name example.com;
       #return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
       #}

         server {
       listen        80 default_server;

       #server_name   example.com;

       #listen 443 ssl;
       #ssl on;
       #ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate/file/domain.crt;
       #ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key/file/domain.key;

}
```

Once the Nginx configuration is established, run the `sudo nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force the Nginx to pick up the changes by running the `sudo nginx -s` reload.

## Configure SSL

If you have an SSL certificate for your domain and need to configure the site with your SSL certificate, follow these steps or you can skip this.

1. Uncomment the following marked lines in the Nginx config file.
![Ssl Config](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/ssl-config.png)
2. Comment the following marked line in the Nginx config file.
![Config Mark](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/ssl-config-mark.png)
3. Replace the `example.com` with your domain name.
4. Define the path of the SSL certificate: `ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/domain.crt`.
5. Specify the directory where the SSL certificate key is located: `ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/domain.key`.
6. Save and run the sudo `nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration file. If the configuration file test is successful, force the Nginx to pick up the changes by running the `sudo nginx -s` reload.

>**NOTE**: If you are configuring the application with SSL, you need to update the URLs in the product.
>json with `HTTPS` located in the `/var/www/bold-services/application/app_data/configuration`.
