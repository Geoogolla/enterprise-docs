# Bold Reports Installation and Deployment on Ubuntu

## Deployment prerequisites

1. Access to a Linux server with a standard user account and sudo privileges.
2. Install `Nginx`by running the following commands:

    ```console
    sudo apt-get update
    ```  
    ```console
    sudo apt-get install nginx
    ```

3. Install `zip` by running the following command
    ```console
    sudo apt-get install zip
    ```
4. Install `GDIPlus` package using the following command.
    ```console
    sudo apt-get install libgdiplus
    ```
5. Add an `openssl conf` path in the environment if it does not exist.
    ```console
    export OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/ssl/
    ```

## Configuring the Bold Reports application

1. Register and download the Bold Reports Linux package from [here](../../../getting-started/#registration-and-download).

2. Download the Bold Reports Linux package by running the following command:
    ```console
    sudo wget {Bold Reports Linux package link}
    ```
3. Extract the zip file by running the following command:
    ```console
    sudo unzip {Bold Reports Linux package zip file}
    ```
4. Change the directory to `BoldReports_EnterpriseReporting-Linux` by running the following command:
    ```console
    cd BoldReports_EnterpriseReporting-Linux
    ```
5. Execute the following command to deploy Bold Reports on your Linux machine.
    ```console
     sudo bash install-boldreports.sh -i {new} -u {user} -h {host URL} -n {true or false}
     ```

     * **i:** Installation type : Specifies either it is a new or upgrade installation.

     * **u:** Specify the user or group that manages the service.

     * **h:** Domain or IP address of the machine with HTTP protocol.

     * **n:** Setting this to `true` will automatically configure the Bold Reports with the Nginx front-end server.

    > **IMPORTANT:** If you have any existing applications running on that Linux machine using Nginx, set “-n” value to false and configure [Nginx manually](#manually-configure-nginx).

    Example for a new installation,

    ```console
        sudo bash install-boldreports.sh -i new -u www-data -h http://linux.example.com -n true
    ```

Once the installation is complete, open the host URL in the browser and continue the application startup.

## Upgrade breaking changes

>**Note**:
> * After upgrading the Bold Reports application to v5.2.26 from v3.1.x, you need to update the below section of the **reportservice** and **viewer** codes in the Nginx configuration file in the location `/etc/nginx/sites-available`.
> * This breaking change should be done for manual Nginx configuration.

Update the below **reportservice** and **viewer** codes in the Nginx configuration file as below:

```cmd
    location /reporting/reportservice {
        root               /var/www/bold-services/application/reporting/reportservice;
        proxy_pass         http://localhost:6553;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
    location /reporting/viewer {
        proxy_pass         http://localhost:6554/reporting/viewer;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
```

Once the Nginx configuration is updated, run `sudo nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force Nginx to pick up the changes by running the `sudo nginx -s reload`.

## Manually configure Nginx

To configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward requests to the Bold Reports app, modify /etc/nginx/sites-available/default. Open it in a text editor and add the following code:

```cmd
       #server {
       #listen 80;
       #server_name example.com;
       #return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
       #}

         server {
       listen        80 default_server;

       #server_name   example.com;

       #listen 443 ssl;
       #ssl on;
       #ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate/file/domain.crt;
       #ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key/file/domain.key;

       proxy_read_timeout 300;
       proxy_connect_timeout 300;

}
```

Once the Nginx configuration is established, run `sudo nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force Nginx to pick up the changes by running the `sudo nginx -s` reload.

## Configure SSL

If you have an SSL certificate for your domain and need to configure the site with your SSL certificate, follow these steps, or you can skip this.

1. Uncomment the following marked lines in the Nginx config file.

    ![Ssl Config](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/ssl-config.png)

2. Comment on the following marked line in the Nginx config file.

    ![Config Mark](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/ssl-config-mark.png)

3. Replace `example.com` with your domain name.
4. Define the path of the SSL certificate: `ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/domain.crt`.
5. Specify the directory where the SSL certificate key is located: `ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/domain.key`.
6. Save and run sudo `nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration file. If the configuration file test is successful, force Nginx to pick up the changes by running `sudo nginx -s reload`.

>**NOTE**: If you are configuring the application with SSL, you need to update the URLs in the product.
>json with `HTTPS` located in the `/var/www/bold-services/application/app_data/configuration`.
