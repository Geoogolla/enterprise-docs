## Upgrade breaking changes

> While upgrading the Bold Reports application from version v3.x to v5.1.20, you need to update the breaking changes for manual Nginx configuration.

**Automatic Nginx configuration**:

* If you preferred automatic configuration during initial installation, below prompt message will be displayed and you can proceed with **Yes** for automatic Nginx configuration. ![Breaking Issue](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation/upgrade-installation-message.png)

**Manual Nginx configuration**:

* For manual Nginx configuration, you need to modify `default` Nginx configuration file in location`/etc/nginx/sites-available`. Open it in a text editor and add the following code, like the below image.

```cmd
    location /reporting/viewer {
        proxy_pass         http://localhost:6554/reporting/viewer;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
```

**Nginx configuration file code**:

Once the Nginx configuration is updated, run the `sudo nginx -t`  to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force the Nginx to pick up the changes by running the `sudo nginx -s reload`.
