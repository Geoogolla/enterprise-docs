> **Important:** The Bold Reports server will accept all the connections that use Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.1/1.2) encryption and AES Cryptography (128 bits). While configuring the Bold Reports Server, choose the `Enable SSL` option to support encrypted data transfer.

> **Note:** We do not have option to create database in MySQL from Azure App service.

Here, user can select simple or advanced mode for configuration.

### Simple mode

Configure a single database for Bold ID and Bold Reports.

This configuration stores the user identities, sites details, reports, users and their access permissions in a single database.

The sites will be deployed to the local file system by default in **Simple mode**

`Bold ID` database stores user identities and sites details.

`Bold Reports` database stores reports, users, and their access permissions.
