# Manage report schedules

Reporting Server provides report-specific schedules to help you control processing and distribution of reports. All schedules specify a type of recurrence: monthly, weekly, or daily.

This section explains on how to add, edit, delete schedules, manage report schedules and also on how to run the schedules on demand and enable or disable schedules in the Bold Reports On-Premise.

Schedules page displays the schedules that are accessible by the user depending on the user’s permission will be shown in the schedules page.
