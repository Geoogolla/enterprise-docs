> 2. To synchronize the Active Directory users, you should import users from the Active Directory to the Bold Reports On-Premise by using the [Import Active Directory Users](/on-premise/manage-users-and-groups/users/import-users/import-active-directory-users/)
> 3. To synchronize the Active Directory groups, you should import groups from the Active Directory to the Bold Reports On-Premise by using the [Import Active Directory Groups](/on-premise/manage-users-and-groups/groups/import-groups/import-active-directory-groups/)
