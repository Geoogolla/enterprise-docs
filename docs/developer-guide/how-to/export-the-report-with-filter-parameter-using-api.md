 2. First, you need to generate the [access token](../generate-access-token-for-bold-reports-server-using-api/).
 3. In request URL, provide your Report Server URL and `reporting/api/site/{tenant-name}/v1.0/reports/export` for [export report](../../../rest-api-reference/v1.0/#operation/Items_ExportReport).
 4. In headers section, add `Authorization` value is `bearer` and add the generated token.
