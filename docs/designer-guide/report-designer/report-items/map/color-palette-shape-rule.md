# Color palette

Based on applied palette name, the fill color will be applied for each map shapes in a layer by venturing through each shading in the palette, and afterward applying progressively lighter shades of each shading in the palette.

Choose the **Color Palette** option in the type drop down, under `Shape Color Rule` category. Now the **Palette** drop-down will start displaying under the type drop-down with set of palette options.

![Map palette types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/map/shape-color-rule/palette-types.png '#width=385px')

For example, set the palette type as `BrightPastel`. Now, the map design with sample data will look like below,

![Color palette](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/map/shape-color-rule/bright-pastel.png)

On report processing based on the selected palette and distribution type, the map shape colors will be automatically distributed on the map surface.
