## Comparison

### Column

| Types           |Description           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Column                |Column Chart allows you to compare values for a set of unordered items across categories through vertical bars ordered horizontally.|
| StackedColumn         |Stacked Column Chart allows you to compare multiple measures through bars stacked one after the other vertically.|
| StackedColumnPercent  |100% Stacked Column Chart allows you to compare multiple measures through bars stacked one after the other vertically.|
| RangeColumn           |Range Column Chart displays information as a range of data by plotting two Y-values (low and high) per data point.|

### Bar

| Types           | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Bar                   |Bar Chart allows you to compare values for a set of unordered items across categories through horizontal bars ordered vertically.|
| StackedBar            |Stacked Bar Chart allows you to compare multiple measures through bars stacked one after the other horizontally.|
| StackedBarPercent     |100% Stacked Bar Chart allows you to compare multiple measures through bars stacked one after the other horizontally.|
| RangeBar              | Range Bar Chart allows you to describe start and end value in a bar chart.|

## Proportion

### Pie

| Types           | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Pie                   |Pie Chart allows you to showcase proportionality of each item to the total in the form of pie-slices.|
| ExplodedPie           |ExplodedPie Chart allows you to separate one or more sectors from the rest of the disk. This effect is used to either highlight a sector, or to highlight smaller segments of the chart with small proportions.|
| Doughnut              |Doughnut Chart allows you to showcase proportionality of each item to the total in the form of doughnut-slices. To plot a doughnut chart, a minimum requirement of 1 value and 1 column is needed.|

### Shape

| Types           | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Pyramid               |Pyramid Chart allows you to make proportional comparison between values showcased as progressively increasing manner. To plot a pyramid chart, a minimum requirement of 1 value and 1 column is needed.|
| Funnel                |Funnel Chart shows values across multiple stages in a process by highlighting different stages with different colors. It allows you make proportional comparison among values showcased in progressively decreasing manner.|

## Distribution

### Area

| Types           | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Area                  |Area Chart allows you to compare values for a set of unordered items across categories through filled curves ordered vertically.|
| SmoothArea            |An area chart where the data points are connected by a smooth line instead of a regular line. Compares the distribution of values over a time period connected using the smooth lines.|
| StackedArea           |Stacked Area Chart allows you to compare multiple measures through filled curves stacked one after the other vertically.|
| StackedAreaPercent    |100% Stacked Area Chart allows you to compare multiple measures through filled curves stacked one after the other vertically.|
| RangeArea             |Range Area Chart displays information as a range of data by plotting two Y-values (low and high) per data point.|
| SmoothRangeAreaChart  |Smooth Range Area Chart is a range area chart in which data points are connected by smooth curves. It displays information as a range of data by plotting two Y-values (low and high) per data point.

### Line

| Types           | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Line                  |Line Chart allows you to showcase trends for analysis over a time period with data points connecting using straight lines.|
| SmoothLine            |SmoothLine Chart allows you to showcase trends for analysis over a time period with data points connected using splines.|
| SteppedLine           |SteppedLine chart allows you to compare the distribution of values over a time period connected using the stepped lines.|
| LineWithMarkers       |LineWithMarkers chart allows you to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group.|
| SmoothLineWithMarkers |Plotted values are represented with a marker point and those points are connected using a smooth line.|

### Scatter

| Types           | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Bubble                |Bubble Chart allows you to compare large number of data points represented as bubbles and showcase the difference through its size.|
| Scatter               |Scatter Chart allows you to compare large number of data points represented as dots irrespective of time.|

### Polar

| Types           |Description |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Radar                 | Radar chart allows you to display multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point.|
| Polar                 |Displays a series as a set of points that are grouped by category on a 360-degree circle.|
