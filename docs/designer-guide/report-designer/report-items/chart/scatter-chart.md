# Scatter Chart

Scatter Chart allows you to compare large number of data points represented as dots irrespective of time.

## Add chart to the report

These types of charts are categorized under the `Distribution` category in item panel.

Drag and drop scatter chart from the item panel into design area.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/scatter-chart/drag-chart-from-item-panel.png)

Now, the scatter chart will be rendered in the design area and the chart properties will be listed in properties panel.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/scatter-chart/initial-view-of-scatter-chart.png)

## Create data

To present data in the chart, create a dataset and bind data to the chart data region. In this designing section, the following dataset query is used for dataset creation.

```sql
SELECT PC.Name AS ProdCat, PS.Name AS SubCat, DATEPART(yy, SOH.OrderDate) AS OrderYear, 'Q' + DATENAME(qq, SOH.OrderDate) AS OrderQtr,SUM(SOD.UnitPrice * SOD.OrderQty) AS Sales
FROM Production.ProductSubcategory PS INNER JOIN
Sales.SalesOrderHeader SOH INNER JOIN
Sales.SalesOrderDetail SOD ON SOH.SalesOrderID = SOD.SalesOrderID INNER JOIN
Production.Product P ON SOD.ProductID = P.ProductID ON PS.ProductSubcategoryID = P.ProductSubcategoryID INNER JOIN
Production.ProductCategory PC ON PS.ProductCategoryID = PC.ProductCategoryID
WHERE (SOH.OrderDate BETWEEN '1/1/2002' AND '12/31/2003')
GROUP BY DATEPART(yy, SOH.OrderDate), PC.Name, PS.Name, 'Q' + DATENAME(qq, SOH.OrderDate), PS.ProductSubcategoryID
```

> Refer [Create Data](/designer-guide/report-designer/manage-data/dataset/create-an-embedded-dataset/#create-an-embedded-dataset) section and create dataset using the above query. `AdventuresWorks` database is used here.
## Assign data

Scatter Chart needs a minimum of 1 value element and 1 column element to showcase. The measure or expression field that you would like to analyze can be dropped into `Y Values` section. The dimension that you would like to categorize the measure, can be dropped onto `Columns` section. If you would like to categorize based on a series, then the respective dimension can be dropped onto `Rows` section in addition.

To configure data into scatter chart follow the steps:

1. To bind data to a chart report item placed in the design area, focus on that report item.
2. Click `Properties` icon in the configuration panel, the property pane opens. Now, switch to `DATA` tab.
   ![Chart properties pane](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/scatter-chart/chart-properties-pane.png)
3. The available data in the report will be listed in the drop-down, choose a data in the drop-down list.
![Choose the dataset for chart](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/data-assign-drop-down.png)
4. The numeric columns and numeric expressions are listed under the `Measures` section; other type of columns and dimension expressions are listed under the `Dimensions` section.
   ![Measures and dimensions](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/scatter-chart/measures-dimensions-category.png)
5. **Drag and Drop Measure Element**:
   Select and drag the numeric column (measure element) or the numeric expression column from the `Measure` section and drop it in the `Y Values` section.
   ![Add a Y-value field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/scatter-chart/add-y-values-field.png)
   Now, the report item design will look like below:
   ![Preview after adding y-value field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/scatter-chart/y-value-chart-design-view.png)
6. **Aggregate Options**:
   Click the `Settings` icon (highlighted below) to open the aggregation type drop-down list.
   ![Aggregate settings icon](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/aggregation-settings-icon.png)
   You can set the aggregation type by which you can compute the selected column.
   ![Aggregate menu list](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/aggregation-settings-menu.png)
7. **Drag and Drop Dimension Element**:
   Select and drag the dimension element from the `Dimensions` section to measure against any of the selected numeric column(s) in `Y Value(s)` section, and drop into the `Column(s)` section.  
   ![Add dimension field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/scatter-chart/add-field-to-column-section.png)
   Now, the report item design will look like below:
   ![Preview after adding dimension field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/scatter-chart/column-field-design-preview.png)
8. **Grouping**:
   You can group the added column element with another column, by adding the respective dimension element into Row(s) section.
   ![Achieve grouping by row values](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/scatter-chart/add-field-to-rows-section.png)
   Now, the report item design will look like below.
   ![Preview of row value grouping ](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/scatter-chart/row-field-design-preview.png)
9. **X-Value(s)**:
 Select and drag the numeric column (measure element) or the numeric expression column from the `Measure` section and drop it in the `X Values` section to plot the data between two values to compare large number of data points.

## Format scatter chart

You can format the scatter chart for better illustration of the view that you require, through the settings available in `Properties` tab.

To format scatter chart follow the below steps:

1. Drag and drop the scatter chart into design area and resize it to required size.
2. Configure the data to the scatter chart.
