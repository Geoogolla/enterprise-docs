# Chart Axis

Charts typically have two axes that are used to measure and categorize data: a vertical (y) primaryYAxis, and a horizontal (x) primaryXAxis. You can customize the axis appearance through the properties provided under the `Category Axis` and `Value Axis` category of chart properties. To customize category axis change the properties under the `Category Axis` property and for value axis change the properties under the `Value Axis` category.

## Axis Type

The Axis Type dropdown displays options for both `Primary` and `Secondary` axes.

![Chart Axis Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/axis-type-dropdown.png)

If you choose the `Primary` option in the Axis Type dropdown, the values designated for the properties below will be applied uniformly to all series marked as primary axes in the chart.

![Chart primary axis options](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/primary-axis-options.png)

Similarly, if you choose the `Secondary` option in the Axis Type dropdown, the values designated for the properties below will be applied uniformly to all series marked as secondary axes in the chart.

![Chart secondary axis options](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/secondary-axis-options.png)

> Note: Axis properties are not applicable for `Proportion` and `KPI` chart types.

The steps outlined above detail the configuration of the category axis, and the process remains consistent for the value axis as well.

## Show or hide axis

To show/hide axis in the chart surface, toggle the `Enable Axis` checkbox in the properties panel.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/enable-axis-checkbox.png)

If you enable the `Enable Axis` checkbox, the chart axis will be displayed in the chart area.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/axes-types.png)

You can also enable or disable the chart axis based on dynamic values, by using the `Expressions`. Refer [Set Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

## Axis Title

The title property in the axis provides options to customize the text and font of the axis title. You can customize the font family, font style, font weight, alignment and size. Axis does not display the title, by default.

To display title text for axis, provide the text in `Axis Title` textbox.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/axis-title-property.png)

Now, the text will be displayed in the respective axis of chart design.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/axis-title-design.png)

To set font weight, color, style, size and alignment, open the `Advanced Menu` of axis title property.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/title-advanced-property.png)

Now, the font properties will listed in the `Advanced Options` menu,

Refer [Set Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

## Label Overflow Mode

The **Label Overflow Mode** property can be used to handle the display mode of the overlapping labels.

### Trim

This option trims the end of overlapping label in the axis.

### Hide

This option hides the overlapping label in the axis.

Refer [Set Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

## Label Rotation

The **Label Rotation** property can be used to define the rotation angle for the axis labels to display in the chart design.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/label-rotation.png)

Increase or decrease the rotation angle in the label rotation numeric textbox,

Refer [Set Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

## Label Format

The **Label Format** property can be used to handle different formatting options like display type, denominations, decimal places, currency culture and negative value display format to the value axis labels.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/label-format.png)

Refer [Format Data](./../../../compose-report/format-data/) section to set different formats to the axis label. Here, the `Currency` format is applied to the `Sales` values in Value axis.

## Interval

The **Interval and Interval Type** properties can be used to to set the interval for category and value axes. The interval property allows you to define the number of intervals you want in the category (x) and value (y) axes and it provides the consistent measurement of the data points in the chart report.

![Interval](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/interval.png)

You can also set the interval and interval type properties based on dynamic values, by using the `Expressions`. Refer [Set Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

## Maximum and Minimum

The **Maximum and Minimum** properties can be used to define the minimum and maximum values on a chart axis.

![Maximum and Minimum](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/maximum-and-minimum.png)

You can also set the maximum and minimum properties based on dynamic values, by using the `Expressions`. Refer [Set Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

## Margin

The **Margin** property specifies the size of the chart's margins. Margins are calculated inward from the specified chart size; increasing the margin size does not increase the total chart size, but rather shrinks the chart area, if necessary.

![Margin](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/margin-property.png)

> This property does not apply to pie, doughnut, funnel, or pyramid chart types.

You can also set the margin property based on dynamic values, by using the `Expressions`. Refer [Set Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

## Include Zero

When the `Include Zero` property is enabled, the y-axis configures the range so that zero is included. But, whenever y values are big and differences among data points are hard to judge, then disable the `Include Zero` property. It makes the y-axis to set a range that provides the differences prominently visible.

![Include Zero](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/include-zero.png)

You can also set the include zero property based on dynamic values, by using the `Expressions`. Refer [Set Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

## Labels AutoFit Disabled

By default, the Interval Auto setting for the chart axis can cause the labels of X/Y axis to show only every second interval. This property can be used to avoid skipping labels at runtime. Enable or disable this property based on the label rendering behaviour of chart design.

![Interval](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/chart-axis/label-autofit.png)

You can also enable or disable the label autofit based on dynamic values, by using the `Expressions`.
