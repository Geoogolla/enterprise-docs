# Chart

Charts can be used to summarize the data in visual format. It helps to present data as bars, areas, lines and many other forms. To present the data, choose the appropriate chart type; it will determine how well the data can be interpreted while visualizing it in the chart form.

## Add chart to the report

To add a `Chart data` region to the report, drag and drop the chart type of your choice from the item panel into design area.
