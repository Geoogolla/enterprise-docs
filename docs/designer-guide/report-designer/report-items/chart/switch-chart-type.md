# Switch chart type

This section explains how to change the type of chart report item during the report design using the chart type switcher in Bold Reports Designer. You can change the chart type using the `Chart Type` dropdown under series properties. To open specific series properties, choose the series name in `Choose Series` dropdown.

Based on the present series chart type, compatible chart types will be listed under chart type dropdown. For example, if the existing series type is pie chart, the chart type dropdown will have chart types as shown below.

## Chart with single series

If the chart has single series, then changing the chart type will directly change the chart to expected chart type. For example, if the report has a column chart with single series.

To change chart series type to `Line`, choose `Line` in chart type dropdown.

## Chart with multiple series

If the chart has multiple series, you can switch chart type for individual series. But it suits only for compatible chart types, otherwise all series in the chart will be changed to the selected chart type.

For example, the below chart design has multiple series. Both series are of column chart type.

For example, now choose `Bar` chart type for second series.
