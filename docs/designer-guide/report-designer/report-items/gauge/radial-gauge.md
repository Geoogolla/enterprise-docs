# Radial gauge

The radial gauges are degrees of circular to represent key performance indication. These can be placed inside the `Tablix` and `Matrix`.

## Add a radial gauge to the report

1. The radial gauge report item is listed in the item panel under the `Deviation category`.
![Radial gauge item in item panel](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/gauge/radial-gauge/item-panel.png)
2. Drag the radial gauge report item into the design area from the item panel.
![Drag the radial gauge report item into design area](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/gauge/radial-gauge/item-drag.png)
3. After dropping the radial gauge item in the design area, the respective item properties will be listed in the properties panel.
