# Gauge

Gauge report items are used to visualize the key performance indicators (KPIs) that track the amount of progress made towards achieving the targets or goals. When placed inside a table or matrix, it illustrates values inside every cell.

## Gauge types

There are two types of gauges, namely `Linear` and `Radial`. These are listed in the item panel under the `Deviation category`.
