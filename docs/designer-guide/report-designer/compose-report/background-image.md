# Background image

Background image property allows you to show an image in the background of a report sections such as the page header, page footer, or report body. The source for background image can be a URL of an image on the report server, an image from a dataset field, or an embedded image.

Open the properties of report sections(page header, page footer, or report body) to which you want to add a background image. The background image properties are listed under `Background Image` category in properties panel.
