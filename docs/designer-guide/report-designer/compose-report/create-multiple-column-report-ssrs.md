description: A report can be divided into columns (imagine columns in a newspaper), that are treated as logical pages rendered on the same physical page.  The detail section is printed once for every row in the data source similarly to a repeater and this happens vertically.

# Create Multiple-Column Report

Multiple column report displays data in multiple sets of columns across the page. On report print action, prints adjacent columns until there is no free space left on a page. You cannot design a report which has a multi-column layout on the top half of the report, and a table layout on the bottom half of the report.

## Properties

Open or create a table report,

Now, open the `Report Properties` in the properties panel by focusing the mouse pointer outside of the design area. Multi-column properties are listed under the `Page Column` category in the properties list.

In `Columns` property, provide the number of columns in the report.

In `Column Spacing` property, type the width of the space between columns.

Then set the required `Margin` and `Paper Size` properties.

In export actions such as HTML, Excel, Word, and CSV, a multi-column layout is displayed as a single column. Only `PDF` and `Power Point` rendering formats displays data in multiple columns.
