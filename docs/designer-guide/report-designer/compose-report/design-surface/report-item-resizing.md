# Report item resizing

To improve the report readability, we can resize the height and width of the report items in design area.

## Resize using resizer

**Resize height**:

To change the height of the report items , place the mouse pointer in the `CenterTop` or `CenterBottom` position of the specific report item selection line.

Use `CenterBottom` to increase height towards downward direction or to decrease height towards upward direction,

Use `CenterTop` to increase height towards upward direction or to decrease height towards downward direction,

**Resize width**:

To change the width of the report item , place the mouse pointer in the `RightCenter` or `LeftCenter` position of the report item selection line.
