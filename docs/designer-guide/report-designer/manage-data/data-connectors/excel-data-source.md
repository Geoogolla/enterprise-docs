# Connect to Excel data source

The Bold Reports allows you to connect to the Excel data source that retrieves data from an excel file and external URL.

## File Prerequisites

2. Prepared workbook should be a structured one. It should be created with unique column names and the value in a row must be in same data type for the corresponding columns.
3. The first row values of your worksheet will be considered as column names by default in Bold Reports. So, provide a unique and meaningful column name in your spreadsheet that will make it easy to identify your data.
4. You can upload a maximum of file size 20 MB.
