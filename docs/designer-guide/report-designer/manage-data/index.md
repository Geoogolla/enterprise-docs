# Manage data

A report must have a data source and dataset to include data. Bold Report Designer provides support to manage your data in reports without writing single line of code. You can explore your data from any of the local or server data bases. Each data source contains data connection information. Each dataset contains a query and collection of fields to represent the data returned from the data source.
