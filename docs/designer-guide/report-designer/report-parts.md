# Report Parts

Report Parts helps users to create and publish report item templates that user may want to reuse across multiple reports. With this functionality, Report items such as tables, charts, maps, indicators, and other report items can be published and reused as report parts in different reports.

To demonstrate the usage of the Report Part feature, we created a new table called `Product_Details_Table` to display the product details.

Consider this scenario, we need to use the Product Details table in various reports. However, creating this table for each report is a tedious process. To address this case, we are publishing the Product Details table as a report part and reusing it in multiple reports.

## Publishing the Product Details Table as a Report Part

1. Click on the `Publish Report Part` option from the dropdown in top-right corner of the report designer page.

2. This action will open the `Publish Report Part` dialog.

3. The report items present on the designer surface will be listed in the Report part dropdown.

4. Select the `Product_Details_Table` report item from the dropdown, name the report part as `Product_Details_Table` in the `Name` field, add description if you want and click the `Publish` button to publish the `Product_Details_Table` report part.

> The Datasource, Dataset and the Query parameters associated with the widgets alone will be published along with the report part whereas Dataset bind with the scope of the expressions and Report parameters will not be published with the report part.

## Reusing the Published Report Part in other Reports

Create a new report and in that we will use the `Product_Details_Table` report part to demonstrate this feature.

1. Find the `Product_Details_Table` report part under the `Report Parts` tab in the left side of the Designer surface.
