# Data sources management in Report Server

You can create and store a data source on the Report Server when you have data source that you use often. When you create a data source to Report Server, it is considered as shared data source that can be used by multiple reports.

It is recommended to use shared data sources as much as possible. It is easier to manage, and help to keep reports and the data sources access more secure. The shared data sources always placed in the `Data Sources` page, they are accessible to the user depending on the user’s permission.

This section about data sources management in Report Server. Allows you to add, update, share and delete shared data sources in the Report Server. The following image shows the list of options available to manage a datasources.
