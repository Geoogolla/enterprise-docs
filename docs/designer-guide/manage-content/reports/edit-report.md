## Edit an existing report as XML

This XML editor provides a user-friendly interface for you to make necessary modifications to the reports in the Report Server. This means you can make necessary changes to the report without downloading it and using a separate text editor.

1. Click the `Actions` button in the Reports grid context menu and choose `Edit As XML` to edit the Report.
