# Version history of report

This section explains how to view the version history of a report in the Bold Reports On-Premise. Versions and file logs for each report will be maintained on the Report Server for every change made to the Report.

Click the `Actions` button in the Reports grid context menu and click the `Version History` option.

## Versions

For each change in the `.rdl` file, a new version will be created. All versions can be individually opened,edited or downloaded in the designer. At any time, the Report can be rolled back to an older version.

## File logs

For each change in the report, including changes in the event, user, and date, the Report Server logs the changes made in the file logs.
