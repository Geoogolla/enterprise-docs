# Dataset management in Report Server

You can create and store dataset on a Report Server that can be used by multiple reports. When you create or upload a dataset to Report Server, it is considered as shared dataset and it always placed in the `Datasets` page. A shared dataset must be based on a shared data source. Datasets are accessible to the user depending on the userâ€™s permission. This section explains about dataset management in Report Server. Allows you to create, edit, update, sharing permissions and delete data sets in the Bold Reports On-Premise. The following image shows the list of options available to manage dataset.

## Create dataset

Dataset can be created only if the user has `Create All Datasets` permission.

### Steps to create a dataset

We can create dataset by following ways.
1. Add dataset from `+` icon.
2. Add dataset from Dataset listing page.

#### Add dataset from `+` icon

* Click on the `+` button in the left side menu and choose `Create Dataset` to add a dataset.

#### Add dataset from Dataset listing page

* Click `Dataset` from left side panel of the Report Server and click `Create my first Dataset` button there is no dataset in listing page or else click  `Create Dataset` button.

* To create dataset, we have use datasource either newly created or else existing datasource. Refer this link for [creating dataset](./../data-sources-management/#add-or-create-data-sources)

    > `Read Write Delete` permission for that `Specific Dataset` will be added for the user who created the dataset.

## Add or upload dataset

1. Click on the `+` button in the left side menu and choose `Upload Dataset` and select `Dataset` to add a dataset.
    ![Upload DataSet](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/upload-dataset-option.png)

2. Enter the name and description of the dataset.
3. Click `Browse` and select the `.rsd` file to upload.
4. Select the `DataSource`. In the select data source dialog, you can either select a data source that is already available in the Report Server or create a new data source at that time itself.

5. Click on the `Save` option, the dataset will be uploaded into the Bold Reports On-Premise and displayed in the list as shown below,
    ![Added datasets list view](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/uploaded-datasets-list.png)

    > `Read Write Delete` permission for that `Specific Dataset` will be added for the user who created the dataset.

## Create report with dataset

Click the `Actions` button in the dataset grid context menu and select `Create Reports` to create a new report with a dataset.

## Edit dataset

Click the `Actions` button in the dataset grid context menu and select `Edit Dataset` to edit a dataset.

## Share dataset

This section explains on how to share dataset with the other users in the Report Server.

### Steps to share a dataset

1. Click the `Actions` button in the dataset grid context menu and select `Sharing Permissions` option.
    ![Manage dataset permission option](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/manage-dataset-permissions.png)

2. Click the `Manage Access` button.
![Set permissions to share a dataset](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/manage-dataset-permission-dialog.png)

3. Select the permission access and the users or groups to share the dataset.
    ![Add permission to dataset](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/add-dataset-permission.png)

4. After selecting the access and users or groups, click on the `Add` button.
![Add button](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/add-access-dataset-permission.png)
> Only the user who have share permission can share the dataset with other Report Server users.

### Remove dataset permission

The user who will have specific permission can remove the shared dataset permissions using the `Remove` option in the `Actions` column of the each permissions.

## Version history

Versions and file logs for each dataset are maintained in the Report Server for every changes in the Dataset. Click the `Actions` button in the grid context menu and click `Version History` option.
![Version History Option](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/versions-history-option.png)

### Versions

For each change in the `.rsd` file, a new version will be created. All versions can be individually opened.

### File logs

For each change in the dataset including changes in the event, user and date.

## Update dataset

1. Click the `Actions` button in the dataset grid context menu and select `Update Dataset` to update the Dataset.
    ![Update DataSet](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/update-dataset-option.png)

2. Enter the name and description of the dataset.
3. Click `Browse` and select the `.rsd` file to upload.
4. Select the `DataSource`. In the select data source dialog, you can either select a data source that is already available in the Report Server or create a new data source at that time itself.
    ![Select a data source for the uploaded dataset](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/update-dataset-dialog.png)

5. Click on the `Update` option, the dataset will be uploaded into the Bold Reports On-Premise and displayed in the list as shown below,
    ![Added datasets list view](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/uploaded-datasets-list.png)

## Delete dataset

Datasets can also be deleted from the Report Server when they are no longer required.

Click the `Actions` button in the dataset grid context menu and select `Delete` to delete the Dataset.
