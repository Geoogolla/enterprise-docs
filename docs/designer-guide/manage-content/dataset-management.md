# Dataset management in Report Server

You can create and store dataset on a Report Server that can be used by multiple reports. When you create or upload a dataset to Report Server, it is considered as shared dataset and it always placed in the `Datasets` page. A shared dataset must be based on a shared data source. Datasets are accessible to the user depending on the user’s permission. This section explains about dataset management in Report Server. Allows you to create, edit, update, sharing permissions and delete data sets in the Bold Reports On-Premise. The following image shows the list of options available to manage dataset.

## Create dataset

Dataset can be created only if the user has `Create All Datasets` permission.

### Steps to create a dataset

We can create dataset by following ways.
1. Add dataset from `+` icon.
2. Add dataset from Dataset listing page.

#### Add dataset from `+` icon

* Click on the `+` button in the left side menu and choose `Create Dataset` to add a dataset.

#### Add dataset from Dataset listing page

* Click `Dataset` from left side panel of the Report Server and click `Create my first Dataset` button there is no dataset in listing page or else click  `Create Dataset` button.

* To create dataset, we have use datasource either newly created or else existing datasource. Refer this link for [creating dataset](./../data-sources-management/#add-or-create-data-sources)

    > `Read Write Delete` permission for that `Specific Dataset` will be added for the user who created the dataset.

## Add or upload dataset

1. Click on the `+` button in the left side menu and choose `Upload Dataset` and select `Dataset` to add a dataset.
    ![Upload DataSet](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/upload-dataset-option.png)

2. Enter the name and description of the dataset.
3. Click `Browse` and select the `.rsd` file to upload.
4. Select the `DataSource`. In the select data source dialog, you can either select a data source that is already available in the Report Server or create a new data source at that time itself.
    ![Select a data source for the uploaded dataset](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/upload-dataset-dialog.png)

5. Click on the `Save` option, the dataset will be uploaded into the Bold Reports On-Premise and displayed in the list as shown below,
    ![Added datasets list view](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/uploaded-datasets-list.png)

    > `Read Write Delete` permission for that `Specific Dataset` will be added for the user who created the dataset.

## Create report with dataset

Click the `Actions` button in the dataset grid context menu and select `Create Reports` to create a new report with a dataset.

## Edit dataset

Click the `Actions` button in the dataset grid context menu and select `Edit Dataset` to edit a dataset.

## Share dataset

This section explains on how to share dataset with the other users in the Report Server.

### Steps to share a dataset

1. Click the `Actions` button in the dataset grid context menu and select `Sharing Permissions` option.
    ![Manage dataset permission option](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/manage-dataset-permissions.png)

2. Click the `Manage Access` button.
![Set permissions to share a dataset](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/manage-dataset-permission-dialog.png)

3. Select the permission access and the users or groups to share the dataset.
    ![Add permission to dataset](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/add-dataset-permission.png)

4. After selecting the access and users or groups, click on the `Add` button.
![Add button](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/add-access-dataset-permission.png)
> Only the user who have share permission can share the dataset with other Report Server users.

### Remove dataset permission

The user who will have specific permission can remove the shared dataset permissions using the `Remove` option in the `Actions` column of the each permissions.

## Version history

Versions and file logs for each dataset are maintained in the Report Server for every changes in the Dataset. Click the `Actions` button in the grid context menu and click `Version History` option.
![Version History Option](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/versions-history-option.png)

### Versions

For each change in the `.rsd` file, a new version will be created. All versions can be individually opened.

### File logs

For each change in the dataset including changes in the event, user and date.

## Update dataset

1. Click the `Actions` button in the dataset grid context menu and select `Update Dataset` to update the Dataset.
    ![Update DataSet](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/update-dataset-option.png)

2. Enter the name and description of the dataset.
3. Click `Browse` and select the `.rsd` file to upload.
4. Select the `DataSource`. In the select data source dialog, you can either select a data source that is already available in the Report Server or create a new data source at that time itself.
    ![Select a data source for the uploaded dataset](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/update-dataset-dialog.png)

5. Click on the `Update` option, the dataset will be uploaded into the Bold Reports On-Premise and displayed in the list as shown below,
    ![Added datasets list view](/static/assets/on-premise/images/manage-content/manage-data-sets/uploaded-datasets-list.png)

## Delete dataset

Datasets can also be deleted from the Report Server when they are no longer required.

Click the `Actions` button in the dataset grid context menu and select `Delete` to delete the Dataset.

> Dataset cannot be deleted if any report uses it.
