# Schedule report settings

This section explains how to use schedule report settings to compress the exported reports as a zip file by using the `Enable File Compression` option.

> This is an optional setting, and you can export the uncompressed report by simply unchecking the `Enable File Compression` option.

## Enable file compression

1. Click on the `Settings` option in the Report Server left-side panel and navigate to the `Reports` tab.
2. Switch to the `Schedule` tab as in the following image

3. Check the `Enable File Compression` option and click on the `Save` button to save the settings.
4. Exported reports can be made more secure with password protection by enabling the `Enable Password Protection` option. The `Default Password` option is selected by default.
    > For the default password, the password will be generated as a combination of the first and last four characters of the email.

5. You can customise the password protection rules for exporting reports by choosing the `Custom Password` option. But the username or first name is mandatory in the password condition.

6. For instance, let's consider a sample user with the following details:
    First Name : John
    Last Name :
    Email: johnmichael@gmail.com

7. With this sample user, the possible password combination and its unlock password have been explained below.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Password Rule
        </th>
        <th>
            Unlock Password
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            The First four characters of the Email <br/> + <br/>
            The Last four characters of the First Name
        </td>
        <td>
            MichJohn
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            First four characters of First Name <br/> + <br/>
            First four characters of Last Name
        </td>
        <td>
            John
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            First four characters of Email <br/> + <br/>
            Last four characters of Last Name <br/> + <br/>
        </td>
        <td>
            johnhael
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
