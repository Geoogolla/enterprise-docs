# Custom schedule report settings

This section explains the custom schedule report settings to customize the `Schedule Template` and the `Predefined Variables`.

## Mail template customization

* The mail template defines the text that is sent via email to the Report Server user.
* Initially, the default template will be displayed in the mail template. If the custom password is enabled, the user can add a password hint to the mail template if necessary.
* And you can also customize the email template to your preference.
