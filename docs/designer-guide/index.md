# Report Designer

The **Report Designer** is a web based reporting tool to create and edit the RDL(Report Definition Language) standard reports. It comes with a wide range of report items to transform data into meaningful information and quickly build the reports with the help of following features.

## Key features

**Data sources** --- Supports commonly used data sources such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, OLEDB, ODBC, Web API, OData, JSON, and XML.

**Built-in query builder** --- Provides a convenient user interface that helps both technical and non-technical users to create and view relationships between tables.

**Report items** --- Provides a rich set of report items like text box, image, line, rectangle, table, list, matrix, more than 20 chart types, sub reports, and barcodes for clear visualization of your data.

**Interactive design surface** ---  Easily arrange report items on the Report Designer surface using simple drag-and-drop operations. Grid lines and snap-to-grid options simplify positioning and aligning of report items.

**Report parameters** --- Supports creating report parameters to specify the data to filter in a report, connect related reports together, and vary report presentation.

**Image manager** --- Allows adding and managing embedded images in a report. Embedding an image ensures the image is always available to a report.

**Property panel** --- Allows customizing the appearance of report items and editing their property values. Users can specify static values or expressions as values in the report item properties.

**Interactive reports** --- Supports creating a report with extremely powerful interactive features provided only by RDL reports, such as drill through and drill down to display data and information in detail.

**Manipulate your data** --- Allows manipulating data with a rich set of features such as sorting, filtering, grouping, and calculated fields.

**Built-in expression editor** --- Allows you to create simple and complex RDL reporting expressions. Supports the use of constants, built-in fields, parameters, data sets, variables, operators, common functions, etc.

**Embedded custom code** --- Supports embedding Visual Basic and .NET code directly within report layouts.
