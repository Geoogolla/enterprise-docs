8. Fill the details as instructed in the following to complete the deployment steps.
    * **Subscription**: Choose the subscription that you have with Azure. Learn more about subscriptions from [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/arunrakwal/2012/04/09/create-windows-azure-subscription/).

    * **Resource group**: This is a logical group in Azure to group your resources like web app, storage account, network etc. Learn more about resource groups from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups).

    * **Location**: Choose the location to deploy the app. **East US** is our recommended location.

    * **Select App Service Need To Deploy**:

    > It is mandatory to have latest User Management Server to run latest Report Server.

9. Select `Report Server with User Management Server` option and this will deploy both Report Server and User Management Server at a single time.

![App service for both Report Server and User Management Server](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation-and-deployment/azure-deployment/app-service-using-arm-template/app-service-ds-ums.png)

> This option will create two app services. One for Report Server and another one for User Management Server. App Service for User Management Server can be created automatically using the App Service name given during deployment

* **Storage Type**: Bold Reports On-Premise stores the resources either in file storage or in Blob storage. Choose a storage type to store files generated by the Report Server.

> While deploying Report Server along with the User Management Server with the Storage type `AzureBlobStorage` selected, both Report Server and User Management Server containers are created under given Blob Storage Name.

Report Server container name – `syncfusionrscontainer` and User Management Server container name - `syncfusionumscontainer`

* **Web App name**: This is the name of the Report Server that you want to have in the URL. As this is going to be the URL, it should be unique globally. Deployment process will be failed, if this is already present and you should start once again with another name.

> Report Server will be deployed under `GivenAppServiceName` and User Management Server will be deployed under `GivenAppServiceName-ums`.

* **Storage account name**: This is optional if you have chosen file storage in storage type and mandatory for Blob storage. This also must be unique as that of the Web App name. Learn more about storage accounts from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-introduction).

* **Storage account type**: This is optional, if you have chosen file storage in Storage type and mandatory for Blob storage. Learn more about storage account types from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-introduction#replication-for-durability-and-high-availability).

* Select the agreement check box and click **Purchase** to deploy the Bold Reports On-Premise Web App.
![Fill app service details](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation-and-deployment/azure-deployment/app-service-using-arm-template/custom-template-details-form.png)

Now, Bold Reports On-Premise App Service(Web App) deployment get started.

The App Service plan for the Web App is created, which will be in `Basic – B1` by default. Learn more about App Service plans from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview). Bold Reports On-Premise Web App does not support free or shared App Service plans.

Bold Reports On-Premise supports basic, standard, and premium App Service plans in the Azure. The minimum recommended App Service plan to run the application is the basic plan.

To get better performance, scale up the App Service plan from basic to standard or premium plans. Refer to the following documentation links to learn how to scale up and scale out the App Service plan.

Scale up: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-scale>

Scale out: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-how-to-scale>

> ARR affinity must be `ON` when Report Server run on multiple instances in Azure App service. While rendering the reports, all the data cached to the server initially, and the subsequent request will use that cached data, which is used to improve the performance in report rendering. So, it is very important to navigate all the requests from a single session into the same machine. If ARR affinity set to `ON`, then all the request from the single session will be sent to the same instance.

To `ON` ARR affinity in app Services, go to your Azure app services and click on the `General settings` tab from the `Configuration`.
![General-Settings](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation-and-deployment/azure-deployment/app-service-using-arm-template/general-settings.png)

Click on `ON` option from the `ARR affinity` and save the settings.
![Arr-Affinity](/static/assets/on-premise/images/installation-and-deployment/azure-deployment/app-service-using-arm-template/arr-affinity-on.png)

> By default, it will be `ON`.

## Configure new Report Server along with User Management Server

After the successful deployment of Report Server and User Management Server Azure on app service,connect the Bold Reports On-Premise with the User Management Server.
