# Add filters to tablix data region

Filters can be used to filter data in the tablix data region or a data region group to include or exclude specific values from display or to provide a different view of the dataset in multiple data regions. When processing the report, the filters applied in the report parts are processed first on the dataset, and then on the data region, and then on groups.

## Set filter on tablix data region

1. Select tablix data region in the design area.

2. In the properties panel, click on the `Set Filters...` button. Now, the filter dialog will be opened like below.

In the above image, three filter equations are created to filter the data in the data region based on `OrderYear`, `Product Category`, and `OrderQtr` data fields. In the below design, two different tablix data regions are designed using single dataset to display the quarter sales `Q1` and `Q2` against a year.

On report preview, using the `OrderYear` and `ProductCategory` report parameters, the sales of `Q1` and `Q2` is displayed in the tablix region based on applied filters.

Before applying filter to the row group, on report preview the report displays sales of each quarters and its total.

After applying filters for the respective row group, the total sales of `Q1` and its total is displayed.

Here, the filter is applied on a row group group for demonstration. Similarly, you can apply filters on column groups and detail groups.
