# Tablix cell

Tablix cell contains the actual content to be presented by the table.

## Change an item within a cell

A tablix cell contains the report items to display the data in the tabular format. By default, all cells in tablix contains the `Textbox` report item. You can place any of the other report items supported in Web Report Designer inside the tablix cell to present data. There are two ways to change an item within a cell.

* Drag and drop report item into table cell
* Insert item using cell menu

### Drag and drop report item into table cell

Drag and drop the required report item into the table cell from item panel.

Now, the item will replace the existing textbox in the cell and inserts a line report item.

Similarly, you can insert other report items into the table cell. The following snap shows the tablix cells with different report items

> When you drag and drop an item into the cell which contains text box, line, image, sub-reports, chart or barcode report item, the old item in the cell will be replaced by a new report item. If the cell contains a report items such as a rectangle, list, table, or matrix, the new item is added to the containing item instead of replacing it. To replace such report item with a new item, delete the respective item from the cell. Deleting the rectangle, list, table, or matrix item replaces it with a text box, which you can then replace with another item.

### Insert item using cell menu

1. Select a cell in tablix and right click in the respective cell. Now, the cell menu will be opened like below.

    > Here, line report item is used to demonstrate the behaviour.

> When you insert item into the cell using the `Insert` option from cell context menu, the report item in the cell will be replaced by a new report item. To insert items inside the container report item such as a rectangle, drag and drop the required report item into the tablix cell containing rectangle.
