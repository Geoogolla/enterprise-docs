# Define custom colors

This option can be used to define any number of colors sets based on your desired output. To define custom colors, follow these steps:

1. In the properties panel, under the **Shape Color Rule** or **Marker Color Rule**category, choose **Custom** in **Type** property. Now, the **Custom Colors** field will start displaying under the type drop-down.

6. Click on the **Update**.

You can also set color based on dynamic values, by using the `Expressions`. Refer [Set Expressions](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expressions](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel. Click on the square icon in the right side of the each field to open expression menu,

Repeat the above steps to create multiple colors sets or edit existing color sets. For example, I have added seven colors in custom colors panel and it will be distributed on the map surface based on the distribution type and data range.

If we apply the same to map markers the colors will be distributed on marker icon background on the distribution type and data range.

## Delete color set

To delete the existing color set, click on the edit icon for the `Custom Colors` property. Now, the available color sets will be listed **Map Custom Colors** panel. Click on the `Delete` icon in the right corner of required color set and click on the **Update**.
