# Custom Distribution

Indicate your own number of data ranges to decide the distribution of values.

Once you select the data value, the properties required to configure distribution type will start displaying under marker color rule category,

## Buckets

To define the data ranges explicitly in the `Buckets` property, refer [Custom Buckets](/report-designer/report-items/map/define-custom-data-range/#add-bucket) section.

On report preview, based on specified data ranges, fill color will be applied on marker icons in the map surface.
