# Formatting Columns

When designing the data in query designer, the columns in the data table can be organized based on your dataset design requirements.

Refer [Create Data](./../../manage-data/dataset/create-an-embedded-dataset/) section for better understanding with the following sections. The below image showcases the initial view of query designer.

## Rename a column

The column names in data table can be renamed in query designer after retrieving the data from data source.

> The column rename action will not affect the actual data in the data source.

Follow the below steps to rename a column in data table.

1. Drag a table or view from the left pane and drop it into the center pane labeled with `Drag and Drop tables here` like below.

1. Exclude the column that you requisite, by clicking the icon at left corner of the respective column name.
