# How to configure custom map shapes

In on-premise server, we can configure the custom shape data to visualize it on map report item. To add custom shape data into on-premise application and use it report designer follow the below steps.

## Place custom shape data file in installed location

In on-premise application, build-in shape data files are located at `{Installed_location}\Bold Reports\Report Server\ReportService\bin\ShapeData`.

Copy your shape data file and paste at this location. For example, **storelocations.js**

## Add file entry

Once you paste the file in mentioned location, open mapshapes.txt file which is available in same location.

## Visualize shape data on map
