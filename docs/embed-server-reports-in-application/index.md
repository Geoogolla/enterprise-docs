### Public embedding

If you want to embed the report without user authentication, then make the report public and then embed it. The public report will be rendered automatically without credentials. You cannot enable the comments panel for public report embedding.

>Embedding the public report will not work when public report setting is disabled. Learn more about the report settings [here](/on-premise/settings/report-settings/)

### Private embedding

Private reports can be embedded, which are accessible to users in the Bold Reports, who has the read permission, and these reports would be requested to login into Bold Report server before rendering. So, embedded report will show the login page whenever private reports are embedded and the user is not authenticated yet.

>By default, report access mode will be set to private until it is changed to the public by the owner of the report.
