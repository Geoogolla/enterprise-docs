# Import Active Directory Groups

The users belonging to the System Administrator group can import Active Directory groups to the Report Sever.

> Active Directory connection must be configured in the [Active Directory Settings](/on-premise/settings/active-directory/) for importing groups.

This section explains how to search and import groups from the Active Directory into the Bold Reports On-Premise.

## Search groups

Initially, any Active Directory group cannot be displayed until searching for the group.

1. Search the Active Directory groups with any one of the following properties:
    * Group name
    * Group description
The Report Server lists the search results in grid as shown in the following image.

    > The search result will be based on "starts with" query.

2. Choose the groups to import into the Report Server.
    > A maximum of 1000 groups will be searched and pulled from Active Directory in a single request.

## Import groups

To import the Active Directory groups into the Report Server, choose the groups from the list and click **Import Groups** at the top-right corner. After importing the Active Directory groups, a confirmation message will be displayed as shown in the following image.
