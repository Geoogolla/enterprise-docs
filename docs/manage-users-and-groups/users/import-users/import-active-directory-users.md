# Import Active Directory users

Users belonging to the System Administrator group can import Active Directory users to the Report Sever.

> Active Directory connection must be configured in the [Active Directory Settings](/on-premise/settings/active-directory/) for importing users.

This section explains how to search and import users from Active Directory into the Bold Reports On-Premise.

## Search users

Initially, any Active Directory user cannot be displayed until searching for users.

1. Search the Active Directory users with anyone of the following properties:
    * User name
    * First name
    * Last name
    * Email address
    * Display name

2. The Report Server lists the search results in grid as shown in the following image.

    > The search result will be based on "starts with" query.

3. Choose the users to import into the Report Server.
    > A maximum of 1000 users will be searched and pulled from Active Directory in a single request.

## Import users

To import the Active Directory users into the Report Server, choose the users from the list and click **Import and Activate** at the top-right corner. After importing the Active Directory users, a confirmation message will be displayed as shown in the following image.
